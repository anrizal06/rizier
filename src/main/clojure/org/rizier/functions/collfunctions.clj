; the missing number must be on the right hand side: (8, 6, 5, 10), then the
; function is recusively called:
; b = 5 + 1 + (4 div 2)
; new partition = (6, 5) and (8, 10)
; We expect to have 3 at the left partition, but we don't; so the missing 
; number must be on the left partition.

; partition = (6, 5) and nil. Since we expect 2 on the left hand side, 
; and indeed we have 2, it must be on the right hand side then.
