(defn accumulate 
   "Reduce a vector xs to another vector by applying f to the second 
    part of a tuple which shares the same first tuple.
    Example: (accumulate + 0 7 [ [4 1] [4 2] [5 8]])
    returns [ [0 0] [1 0] [2 0] [3 0] [4 3] [5 8] [6 0]] .
    This is similar to accumArray function of Haskell."
